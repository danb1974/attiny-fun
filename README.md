#### I'm a tiny attiny

#### 7-segment clock (work in progress)

As a first experiment, we'll put to work a noname oled display (128x64, SH1106-based, I2C bus) which has the first two rows damaged. Wish I knew beforehand how fragile these things are (don't even stare at the two glass corners opposed to the connector or they will break).

Quite a rollercoaster - TinyWireM not working well, U8x8 consumes too much memory and has it's own wire code...
